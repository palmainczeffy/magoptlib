# magoptlib

Magoptlib is a Python library designed for the Global Spherical Harmonic Analysis (GSHA) of magnetic fields. The library provides tools for  calculating spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients from measurement data on a sphere, and calculating the magnetic field values at any arbitrary location outside this sphere. It supports the preparation of the optimization of magnet placement. For further information please read the documentation or run the inroduction.ipynb file.

## Installation

For installing the library, use:
```bash
$ pip install magoptlib
```

## Usage

Please find an example usage in the documentation or in the introduction.ipynb file.

## Credits

`magoptlib` was created with [`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the `py-pkgs-cookiecutter` [template](https://github.com/py-pkgs/py-pkgs-cookiecutter).

This package is inspired by [`dipy`](https://dipy.org/index.html), which provided the foundational ideas for the spherical harmonic coefficient calcuation.
